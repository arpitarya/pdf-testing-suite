## §1 — For humans

<Two or three short paragraphs: what this decides and why anyone should care.
Present tense.>

## §2 — For agents

### Context

What forces are at play? What problem does this solve? Why now?

### Decision

Numbered, present tense, imperative where it binds, so another record can cite
`decision 3`.

### Consequences

What becomes easier, harder, owed. Name the debt: a `B-nnn` row in
`work/BACKLOG.md` if nobody is doing it, a `W-nn` if someone is.

### Alternatives considered

One line per option minimum, and why each lost. A real fork links its
`work/compare/` doc.

### Reference (required)

At least one grounding reference — code at a path, a live doc, measured
evidence. **Never an archived doc.**

### Veto condition

**Reopen this decision if:** <the checkable condition>

**How to check it:** `<command or the exact place to look>`
