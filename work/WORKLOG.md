# WORKLOG — the append-only session log

Every session appends **one entry before it ends** — a chat-only session
counts. **Never edit a past entry; append only, newest on top.** A wrong old
entry is corrected by a new one. Distinct from `INTERVIEW.md`, which is the
*current* state of play. Rules: [SR-WORK-SESSION](../records/0054_WORK-session.md).

**Entry format:**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line title>  ·  <surface> (<model>)

- **Asked:** *<the ask>*
- **Done:** <what landed, with commit shas where they exist>
- **Decided / left open:** <rulings taken in-session; forks put to Arpit and Siddharth>
- **Mistakes:** <what went wrong and what was done about it, or "none">
- **Next:** <the single next step>
```

## 2026-10-13 — the work system set up from WORK-SYSTEM.md  ·  Claude Code (Opus 5.5)

- **Asked:** *check out main, branch, and set up the work process from WORK-SYSTEM.md; deciders Arpit and Siddharth; records cover everything in the repo; do not archive anything.*
- **Done:** branch `work-system-setup`; records 0001–0003 and 0051–0060; `work/`; `docs/GLOSSARY.md`; empty `archive/`; `scripts/`; `.claude/` hooks and `settings.json`; `CLAUDE.md` (new — none existed).
- **Decided / left open:** decider is "Arpit and Siddharth" (two humans, their ruling); every tracked product path owned by W-01 until records claim it; WORK-SYSTEM.md was **not** added to the repo nor archived (ruling: archive nothing — the records are now the only home of its rules); tests deferred as B-001–B-005; template citations for B-003/B-004 corrected to real locations.
- **Mistakes:** none.
- **Next:** Arpit or Siddharth installs the commit-msg guard and commits the setup; then W-01.
